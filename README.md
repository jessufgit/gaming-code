# Nicolas_Cage_Scraper

This application, written in Python, provides the user with a random Nicolas Cage photo and a random movie quote. Placecage.com provided 4 links to Nic Cage photos which I placed in an array and accessed through a random int as the index. I used the same strategy of creating an array of random quotes which could be found at: https://www.bustle.com/articles/12026-counting-down-50-of-nicolas-cages-most-ridiculous-movie-quotes-for-his-50th-birthday. Upon running the program cage_scrape.py an html file is created, code is added and saved, and then a new web browser window is opened with the functioning code.

Note: You do need to change the code on line 38 of cage_scrape.py to reflect where you saved this repository. You will get an error in the terminal if you do not make that change, but you will see a random quote generated in the terminal window. For example, this is the code I needed on line 38: ('file:////Users/jessicahorton/Desktop/Dev/PythonAndDjango/Nicolas_Cage_Scraper/' + 'nicolas_cage.html'
