<h2><strong>Python</strong></h2>

This repository was created specifically to help me to understand the structure and function of git hub. I am using it to practice uploading code, committing changes, forking, cloning, etc. Code in this repository will primarily be written in Python with the occasional bit of HTML.

Each file represents a game that I have started to code as I practice writing in python.
